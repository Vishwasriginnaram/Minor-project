                    <div class="mt-2 md:mt-4 text-white md:text-[13px] lg:text-sm xl:text-base">Established in 1965 by our grandfather, late Shri Rambhat Joshi MA Music, our institute has a rich history of teaching music. In 2017, we started Sri Sharada Sangeet Vidyalayam at our home in Manjeeranagar, Sangareddy, with 5 students. Despite the challenges, we grew and achieved 100% pass rates in music exams. Today, our academy has flourished with over 70 students pursuing their musical journey, and we're proud to see it continue to grow. We overcame the COVID-19 pandemic by starting online music classes in 2021 with courage.</div>
